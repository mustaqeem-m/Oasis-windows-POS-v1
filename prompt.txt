When the user selects a tax percentage from the Order Tax dropdown (e.g., GST@5%, GST@18%, etc.) and clicks the Update button, the following behavior must occur dynamically:

✅ Expected Behavior:
Calculate the Tax Amount:

Multiply the cart subtotal by the selected tax percentage.

Example: If subtotal is ₹200.00 and tax is 5%, Order Tax = ₹10.00

Display Tax Amount:

Immediately update the ₹0.00 label below "Order Tax (+)" in the cart summary section with the newly calculated tax amount (e.g., ₹10.00).

This value must be dynamically fetched and calculated — not hardcoded.

Update Total Payable:

Add the Order Tax amount to the Total Payable value at the bottom bar (green strip).

Example: Total Payable = Subtotal + Tax → ₹200.00 + ₹10.00 = ₹210.00

Reflect this update instantly in the bottom right corner UI (Total Payable: ₹210.00)

DO NOT update the main "Total" on the right panel. Only Total Payable must include tax.

⚠️ Bug:
Currently, after clicking Update, the value below Order Tax remains ₹0.00 and Total Payable is not increasing — even though a valid tax was selected.
