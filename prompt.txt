When the user clicks the edit (🖊) icon next to Shipping, display a modal titled "Shipping" with a structured form layout.

🧾 Modal Field Layout (Left to Right, Top to Bottom):
🔸 Row 1 (Two Half-Width Textareas):
Shipping Details* (Required)

Multiline input box (left side, 50% width)

Shipping Address

Multiline input box (right side, 50% width)

🔸 Row 2:
Shipping Charges* (Required)

Numeric input field (left side, 50% width)

Shipping Status

Dropdown (right side, 50% width)

Static options (predefined):

Ordered

Packed

Shipped

Delivered

Cancelled

🔸 Row 3:
Delivered To

Single-line text field (left side, 50% width)

Delivery Person

Dropdown (right side, 50% width)

Dynamically fetch delivery personnel list from backend

🔄 Behavior:
On clicking Update, all input data must be saved and synced with the order.

Shipping Charges (if non-zero) should reflect in the order summary but only affect the Total Payable, not the item total.

Cancel closes the modal with no changes.

🔍 UX/Size Notes:
All text fields and dropdowns are aligned in a 2-column grid layout (50% width each).

Textareas are larger and multiline for better detail entry.

Delivery Person and Shipping Status are both dropdowns, sized to fit the column.
