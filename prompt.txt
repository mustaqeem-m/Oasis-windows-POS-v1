You are working on a Flutter desktop POS application. When a user clicks on a product from the product grid, that product gets added to the cart. Each added product should display inside the cart section as a "cart card".

Design a Flutter UI widget for the cart card that appears in the cart list. The card must include:
- Product name (bold and clear)
- Quantity (default 1, with + and - buttons to update)
- Price per item and total price (quantity Ã— unit price)
- A remove/delete icon button
- Layout optimized for desktop screen
- All items aligned properly (row-based layout)
- Proper padding and spacing, no overlapping
- Consistent with a professional POS design


like in cart.dart page , but i need it in product.dart under left panel's , cart item 

DO NOT modify any cart logic or state management. Just design the cart card widget assuming `CartItem` model with `name`, `price`, and `quantity`.

Output clean Dart code for this widget only.
