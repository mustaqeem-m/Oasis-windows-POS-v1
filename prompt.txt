When the user clicks the "Service Staff Replacement" icon in the topbar, display a floating popup as follows:

- Appears directly under the clicked icon with a small arrow/caret pointing upward at the icon
- Popup title: "Service staff replacement" (simple, bold font)
- Contains a single input box with the placeholder text "Invoice No."
- Below the input box, place a red-bordered, rounded rectangular button labeled "Send" with red text and white background
- Button must be styled to highlight on hover and trigger a function (e.g., sendInvoiceNo()) when clicked

UX Behavior:
- Popup should automatically close if the user clicks outside
- Input must allow free text (invoice number)
- If no value is entered and the user clicks "Send", highlight the input in red to indicate validation error

Styling:
- Clean white background
- Rounded corners
- Soft shadow to float above UI
- Responsive and minimal design

No hardcoded invoice numbers. All content should be dynamic and based on user input.
