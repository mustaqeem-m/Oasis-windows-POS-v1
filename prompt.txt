When the user clicks on the fullscreen icon located in the topBar, open a new page wrapped inside a Scaffold layout. This page must be a live sales cart view, visually similar to a POS terminal interface.

Behavior & Structure:
Fetch all data dynamically from the app’s current sales session (no static or hardcoded data allowed).

Display a table-like layout with the following columns:
Product, Quantity, Price inc. tax, Subtotal

Below the table, show a summary row that includes:

Items: [count]

Total: ₹ [total]

Discount (-): ₹ [discount amount]

Order Tax (+): ₹ [tax amount]

Shipping (+): ₹ [shipping amount]

Total Payable: ₹ [payable amount] (in bold green text)

Payment Info Section:
At the bottom in a colored box (orange background), show:

Total Paying: ₹ [amount]

Change Return: ₹ [amount]

Balance: ₹ [amount] (balance in red/pink)

Additional Requirements:
Provide navigation or a return mechanism to go back to the product page from this fullscreen sales view.

All components must update based on live sales data in real-time or upon relevant user action.
