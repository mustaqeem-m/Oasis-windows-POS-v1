 Gemini CLI Prompt — Cart Summary Section (Exact Alignment & Text Style)
Refactor the Cart Summary Section UI at the bottom of the left panel in product.dart to match the exact layout and styling of a modern POS web app.
🔒 Keep my logic and values intact. Only adjust the UI layout, alignment, icons, and text styling using Flutter.

🔷 Summary Items to Display:
Items

Total

Discount (–)

Order Tax (+)

Shipping (+)

Packing Charge (+)

Round Off

🔧 Redesign Instructions:
Two-line layout:

Line 1: Items: and Total: — bolded, inline, full-width aligned

Line 2: All remaining charges, spaced evenly

Text Styling:

Labels (Discount, Order Tax, etc.) should be semi-bold

Values should be right-aligned, bold, and consistent in font size

Use dark text color (#1E1E1E or similar) for values

Icons:

Add blue info (ℹ️) icon beside:

Discount

Order Tax

Shipping

Packing Charge

Add edit icon (✏️) beside the values that are editable

All icons should be compact, same height as text, and evenly spaced

Alignment & Layout:

Use Row layout for inline fields

Wrap each row item in a fixed-width container if needed for even spacing

Ensure total widths don’t break on resize — use Expanded, Spacer, SizedBox as needed

Container Styling:

Use white background with slight shadow or light grey border

Padding: consistent inner spacing all around (e.g., EdgeInsets.all(12))

Bottom border or separation from cart section above

❌ Do Not:
Change data values or business logic

Hardcode any number

Break state bindings or delete existing variables
