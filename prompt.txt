In my Flutter Windows desktop app, I have a calculator icon in the top bar. When the user clicks this icon, I want a custom calculator widget to appear like a dropdown popup (refer to the attached design).

✅ Requirements:

The calculator should open directly below the icon (like a dropdown with a pointer).

The calculator should have basic functionalities: AC, CE, +, -, *, /, =, 0-9, ., %.

Each button should be styled with color like the image:

AC = Red background

CE = Orange background

= = Green background

It should not navigate to a new screen; just display as a floating popup/card.

The calculator UI should be consistent with Windows desktop apps and responsive in size.

❗Make sure:

The calculator hides if clicked outside.

It appears as a rounded, slightly elevated popup with a pointer triangle at the top.

It supports mouse click input only (keyboard not mandatory).
