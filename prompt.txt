When the user clicks on the fullscreen icon in the topBar, open a new Scaffold page designed as a Customer Display Screen. This screen must exactly replicate the layout shown in the provided screenshot using only live sales data from the current transaction â€” no static or hardcoded values.

Layout Structure (as per screenshot):
ðŸ”¹ Top Section (Table Header)
Display a table with the following column headers:

Product

Quantity

Price inc. tax

Subtotal

ðŸ”¹ Middle Section (Product Rows)
Show real-time rows of each product added to the cart:

Product name

Quantity selected

Price per unit including tax

Subtotal for that product (price Ã— qty)

Ensure the table auto-refreshes in sync with the main POS cart.

ðŸ”¹ Summary Section (Bottom)
Align the following summary rows just below the table:

Items: [total items count]

Total: â‚¹ [raw total]

Discount (-): â‚¹ [discount amount]

Order Tax (+): â‚¹ [tax amount]

Shipping (+): â‚¹ [shipping amount]

Total Payable: â‚¹ [grand total] (in bold green)

ðŸ”¹ Final Orange Bar (Bottom Highlight)
This section must be visually prominent and display:

Total Paying: â‚¹ [amount paid]

Change Return: â‚¹ [if any]

Balance: â‚¹ [if any due] (amount shown in red/pink)

Additional Notes:
Do not display any buttons or interactive controls.

All amounts must be fetched from the live current cart state in real time.

Ensure values like totals and taxes are formatted properly with commas and two decimal places, prefixed by â‚¹.
